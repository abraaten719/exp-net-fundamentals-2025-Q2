# exp-net-fundamentals-2025-Q2
**About me: I saw this bootcamp 1 day before it started. I am working full time and homeschooling kiddos. I have 7 kids. I work in Infrastructure and DevOps. I am Net+ certified and would love a refresher. Plus I need to learn to do diagrams better and also the code side of things. Newish to GitHub. 

**6/7/25 - Watched the 2nd live and catching up on the first week of homework. 
*** Using AWS provider Do you need my accout number?
***Having issues connecting to the ubuntu server. Getting the error "No supported authentication methods available" and "Server refused our key" Going to start from scratch and try again.....
***I know what I did....got it working. Started an instance in amazon linux instead of ubuntu.
