# exp-net-fundamentals-2025-Q2
**About me: I saw this bootcamp 1 day before it started. I am working full time and homeschooling kiddos. I have 7 kids. I work in Infrastructure and DevOps. I am Net+ certified and would love a refresher. Plus I need to learn to do diagrams better and also the code side of things. Newish to GitHub. 

**6/7/25 - Watched the 2nd live and catching up on the first week of homework. 
*** Using AWS provider Do you need my account number?
***Having issues connecting to the ubuntu server. Getting the error "No supported authentication methods available" and "Server refused our key" Going to start from scratch and try again.....
***I know what I did....got it working. Started an instance in amazon linux instead of ubuntu. 

**6/8/25 - Today is just not my day....Was going thru the video, created the deployment of the vm windows server on Azure, went to take a screenshot of the machine to show as proof, found out all my files were being deleted. Found out OneDrive decided today to do a full backup and is in the process of moving 60GB to OneDrive. This took forever! I have a lot of iso's on my student laptop from previous classes. Now most of it is done, after about 3 hours, still no files. I had to re-clone the repo to local to get them back and it got put in a nesting doll of the previous version. 

Now that that's done, all my work from today is gone and I will have to go through and redo it all, including adding all the screenshots and folders for today and these crazy notes. 

Took hours (about 6-7) to try to get Azure template working.....along with the issues from earlier today. Did find out that it was vs studio that kept deleting my files anytime I did a git checkout main. So I am back to no files..... I have to keep working so I will have to clone the repo again.

So when I was able to get into the packet tracer on the local, it deleted my Journal.md. I will need to redo that one again but at least I saved the other Journal file on the windows-networking folder by copying the old one before I was able to get into the local repo. I really don't like working out of the github repo, prefer the local but seriously sooooooooo much has gone wrong today.
