## Downloaded Azure Resource Template

After deploying my Microsoft Windows Server 2025 to Azure VM, I downloaded the Resource Templates to be able to easily deploy again

## Prompted for ChatGPT to help with the template

We prompted for ChatGPT to help with the parameters, mine had worked when I connected so I was following along and found out that I need to install the Azure CLI. 

## Installing the AZ CLI

From ChatGPTs prompting, I followed the steps to install the CLI. I was getting errors though so it recommended for me to reopen all terminal sessions after install. I am still new to GitHub so it took me a while to find out how to reopen the desktop version. After reopening I was able to login to the Azure CLI/Azure cloud platform. Yay!

## Converting Resource Template to Azure Bicep

Andrew had issue with launching the Server which had no Windows UI. We are going over how to convert the resource template files to Azure Bicep.

Install and Login to Azure CLI

'''sh
curl -sL https://aka.ms/InstallAzureCLIDeb | sudo bash
az ligin --use-device-code
'''

Convert to Azure Bicep

'''sh
cd projects/ip-address-management/template/vm
az bicep decompile --file template.json
'''

"After decompiling I noticed the files were still verbose.
It turns out that decompile with Bicep will make the output 1:1 to json.
I asked ChatGPT to refactor the code to reduce the verboseness of the code.

## Chat GPT helped with param/template

This took like an hour to get the template working. I had the ChatGPT help me weed out the errors and found out that all that was wrong was I didn't save the template....ugh....

I was able to start up the service/VM using the template and bash/az cli.

## Updating parameters file

Still checking / rechecking the vms in azure. It didn't actually create anything. Working with ChatGpt to try to update the params file to create in a different region so that it will create.

## Conclusion

I was still unable to create the vm from the template. I kept running into errors with the image or the file path or even that the content for this response was already consumed. I did a verification to check for the resources in the environment and it said they were there but still not showing up back in azure. I can still log into the vm I created earlier if we need to go over that. I have been working on this for over 7 hours.
